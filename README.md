👋 Hi, I'm @dolphine1 – Call me Dolph

👀 I'm captivated by the limitless potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). I believe they're the future of problem-solving and innovation.

🌱 I'm currently diving deep into:
   * Front-end development: React, Vue, node.js and the art of crafting seamless user experiences. 🎨
   * Core AI/ML principles: Algorithms, data structures, and the magic behind neural networks. 🤖
   * Cloud technologies: Exploring the scalability and power of AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. ☁️

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of AI and ML in real-world applications. Think chatbots, recommendation systems, image recognition... the sky's the limit!
